                  We may offer certain Services on an ongoing subscription basis
                  (Subscription). You may purchase a Subscription by paying the
                  Price for the Subscription outlined on the Site in advance on
                  a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to
                  you prior to your payment of the Price (Billing Cycle).
                </li>
                <li>
                  At the end of the first Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
                  automatically renew for recurring monthly periods of time
                  (each of which will be considered a Billing Cycle) unless and
                  until you cancel your Subscription. You will be charged the

                <li>
                  We may need to change what is available as part of your
                  Subscription (for example, the inclusions, exclusions, updated
                  features) from time to time. If we change what is available as
                  part of your Subscription, we will provide you with at least
                  30 days’ notice of the change. After the notice period has
                  lapsed, we will apply the changes to your Subscription. If the
                  changes adversely affect your enjoyment of the Subscription,
                  you may cancel your Subscription with effect from the date we
                  apply the changes to your Subscription by providing written
                  notice to us. If you cancel your Subscription, (a) you will no
                  longer be able to use the Services on and from the date of
                  cancelation, and (b) if you have paid the Price upfront you
                  will be issued a pro-rata refund having regard to the date of
                  termination and the period for which you have paid.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We may need to change the Price from time to time. If we
                  change the Price, we will provide you with 30 days’ notice of
                  the change. After 30 days, we will apply the updated Price to
                  your Subscription. If the updated Price is not acceptable to

                  6.1 Pick-up time: Unless otherwise agreed with you, we will
                  pick your dog up from the location requested by you in the
                  Appointment on or around the time requested in the
                  Appointment. If you (or an authorised person noted on your
                  Appointment, or otherwise communicated to us) are not home at
                  the pick-up time, we will contact you and wait for up to 15
                  minutes for you to provide us with your dog. If you (or the
                  authorised person) do not show, then you agree that we may
                  leave the pick-up location, and the dog walking services will
                  be deemed to be completed. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                  we cannot provide the dog walking services because you do not
                  provide us with your dog, you will still need to pay us the
                  relevant Price for the dog walking services. You agree that
                  this is a genuine pre-estimate of the loss we suffer by
                  investing time into picking up the dog.

                <li>
                  6.2 Drop-off: We will drop your dog back off to the pick-up
                  location on or around the time communicated to you in the
                  Appointment. If you (or your authorised person) are not home
                  to take back custody of the dog, you agree that we may charge
                  a late fee of £[20] per hour and take your dog back to our
                  [insert e.g. your address]. If the dog is not picked up before
                  5pm that day, we reserve the right to drop the dog off at the
                  local police station or take the dog to one of our staff’s
                  homes for the evening.

                  team is unwell, or due to adverse or unsafe weather
                  conditions, we will aim to provide you with as much notice as

                    <li>
                      (a) 24 hours’ notice prior to the Appointment for a

                  You can provide notice to us by calling or emailing us using
                  the contact details at the beginning of these Terms within the
                  above timeframes, otherwise you will be charged full price for

                  7.3 If you need to cancel an Appointment in accordance with
                  clause 7.2(c) above, please note we operate a three strikes
                  policy for sickness. If you cancel on grounds of sickness more
                  than three times in one calendar month, we will charge you the
                  full price for [the third cancelled Appointment].
                </li>
                <li>
                  7.4 If you are more than 15 minutes late in dropping off your
                  dog to the Appointment and do not contact us in advance to let
                  us know, the Appointment will be considered cancelled by you
                  without notice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  7.5 Where you do not provide us with notice to cancel an
                  Appointment in accordance with clause 7.2, or you are more
                  than 15 minutes late to the Appointment, the Price will
                  constitute the cancellation fee. You acknowledge and agree
                  that this is a genuine pre-estimate of our loss arising as a
                  result of your failure to give us notice of your
                  unavailability, or attend your appointment on time.

                  is possible. If it is possible, we will let you know about any

                  deliberate default) and 16.2 (liability which cannot legally
                  be limited) but despite anything else to the contrary, to the
                  maximum extent permitted by law:

                    <li>
                      (a) if you are not a consumer, neither Party will be
                      liable for any Consequential Loss. If you are a consumer,
                      we only supply the Services for domestic and private use.
                      If you use the Services for any commercial, business or
                      re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for
                      liability involving any loss of profit, loss of business,
                      business interruption, or loss of business opportunity;

                    <li>
                      (b) a Party’s liability for any liability under these
                      Terms will be reduced proportionately to the extent the
                      relevant liability was caused or contributed to by the
                      acts or omissions of the other Party (or any of its
                      Personnel), including any failure by that other Party to
                      mitigate its loss; and

                    <li>
                      (c) unless you are a consumer, our aggregate liability for
                      any liability arising from or in connection with these
                      Terms will be limited to us resupplying the Services to
                      you or, in our sole discretion, to us repaying you the
                      amount of the Price paid by you to us in respect of the
                      supply of the relevant Services to which the liability
                      relates. If either Party fails to comply with these Terms,
                      neither Party will be responsible for any losses that the
                      other Party suffers as a result, except for those losses
                      which are a foreseeable consequence of the failure to
                      comply with these Terms.

                  18.11 Severance: If a provision of these Terms is held to be
                  void, invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision is to
                  be read down as narrowly as necessary to allow it to be valid
                  or enforceable, failing which, that provision (or that part of
                  that provision) will be severed from these Terms without
                  affecting the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
                  that provision or the other provisions in these Terms. If any
                  provision or part-provision of these Terms is deemed deleted
                  under this clause 18.3, the Parties will negotiate in good
                  faith to agree a replacement provision that, to the greatest
                  extent possible, achieves the intended commercial result of
                  the original provision.
